# List of stages, in order of execution
stages:
  - test

# Common commands to be executed before each job
before_script:
  - source /home/salas/fosshdl/env.rc

# Each job:
#   - belongs to a stage
#   - runs inside a docker image (which in our case contains all the software we need)
#   - has a script with the commands to execute
#   - generates artifacts which can be used by other jobs and downloaded by the user
#   - one of those artifacts is the xml report in JUnit format, which is read by gitlab
